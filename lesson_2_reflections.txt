-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You add a .git folder which will keep track of meta data for tracking versions.
You need to do it so that there is somewhere to store your commit information.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it's different from the working directory in that the files are marked for commit where not all the files in the working directory have to be .
It's different from the repository because the files haven't been committed yet.
It offers value in that it lets you control which files are committed without haveing to create a deperate directory.

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare the staged doc to the most recent commit to see exactly what changes have been made. 
If there haven't been enough made for a commit to make sense you can compare the working copy to the staged copy after making additional changes.

-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    Branches would help whn adding experimental features or trying something you aren't sure you will want to keep.
    They let you make changes to the code while retaining a clean copy that you can easily return to and work on independently.
    
-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    They help you see the relationship of commits both along the same and different branches and illustrate the concept of reachability.
    
-What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
    When two branches are merged the changes to them both are combined.
    They are diagramed that way because both branches become the parents of the new branch.
    
-What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
    Pros: simplifies basic merging tasks, notifies you of conflicts, does difference searching for you
    Cons: conflicts might not always be logical
