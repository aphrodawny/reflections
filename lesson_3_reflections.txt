-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are working collaboratively with other people on a project.
  if you might be using more than one computer to do the work (ie work and home computers).
  
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    So that you are only making the changes you are ready for. Only working changes go to public repositories and you only pull changes that are needed if working on a branch.
