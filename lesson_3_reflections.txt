-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are working collaboratively with other people on a project.
  if you might be using more than one computer to do the work (ie work and home computers).
  
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    So that you are only making the changes you are ready for. Only working changes go to public repositories and you only pull changes that are needed if working on a branch.
    
-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    A fork is a copy from one github repository to another. It's used to make your own version of a repository while still giving credit to the original.
    A clone is a copy to or from a local repository. It's used for working locally.
    A branch is a different version within a single repository. It's used for trying out new features without disrupting the original.
    
-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    For the sake of comparing changes made since last accessing the remote.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    By emailing copies of files or working off of a shared file on a server.  
    Working on your own copy would be easier but keeping track of changes, contributions, and conflicts would be harder.
